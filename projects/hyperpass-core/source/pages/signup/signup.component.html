				Your master password isn't sent to our servers in any form, meaning you alone control access to your personal data. With this security comes responsibility: if you forget your Hyperpass login credentials, we cannot unlock your data for you. As such, it's a good idea to keep a written copy of your Hyperpass login information in a secure location. This is the password which will guard all your other passwords, so make it a good one! You can click 'Generate' to have a master password created for you. Minor modifications are encouraged as human input makes generated passwords even more secure while also making them easier for you to remember.
