		<h3>An Introduction to Hyperpass</h3>

		<p>With all the digital accounts we have, password management is essential. We need a secure place to keep all our digital account information, and we need to be able to access that information from anywhere. Hyperpass is a password manager with a modern and consistent user interface available across web, desktop, and mobile. You can securely store your account information in the Hyperpass vault and access it from any device.</p>

	<div class="article-section">
		<h3>Creating an Account</h3>

		<p>To get started, you will need to make an account. On the <a href="signup" target="_blank">Sign Up</a> page, enter the email address and master password you want to use. Unlike other services, your master password is not stored on the Hyperpass servers in any form, and the information you store in your vault is always encrypted before it leaves your device. This ensures that only you will be able to access your sensitive information, and that the data in your vault will be secure even if the Hyperpass servers were to be compromised. However, because only you hold the keys, access to your Hyperpass account or vault cannot be restored if you forget your credentials. With this in mind, please store a physical copy of your Hyperpass login information in a secure location. Pressing the 'Generate' button will create a master password for you. To make the generated password extra secure, add some human input to it. For example, you could add an additional word or symbol.</p>

		<p>When you are finished, press the 'Sign Up' button on the bottom right. You will then be redirected to the validation page. To confirm that you are the owner of the email address you entered, an email containing a validation code will be sent to you. Enter that code on the validation page to complete the signup process. If you do not see the email address in your inbox, please wait a few minutes or check your spam folder. You can also send the validation email by pressing the 'Resend' button. After you have entered the code, press the 'Validate' button. You will now be able to log in to your account and start using Hyperpass.</p>

	<div class="article-section">
		<h3>First Steps</h3>

		<p>Because Hyperpass is designed to be available wherever you need it, there are many options for app downloads and browser extensions. Using the web app is an easy way to get started as it requires no installation. You can access the web app at any time by going to this website and pressing the 'Web App' button in the navigation menu on the top right. However, if you are using a smartphone, you may want to start with the Android or iOS app instead as it provides a better mobile experience than the web version. Whichever your choice is, the interface of Hyperpass is consistent, so everything covered here can be applied no matter what platform you are on. Any features that are unique to individual platforms will be mentioned specifically.</p>


		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/login-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [aspect]="100/30" [verticalAspect]="100/36"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>To log in, enter your username and master password, then press the 'Log In' button. You will then be brought to the main Hyperpass app. The app has three pages: 'Vault', 'Generator', and 'Options'. By default, you will be on the Vault page. You can switch to the other pages by pressing their titles at the top of the app. Alternatively, if you are on mobile, you can swipe left and right to quickly move between pages.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="separator"></div>

	<!-- Vault – Adding Entries. -->
	<div class="article-section">
		<h3>Vault – Adding Entries</h3>

		<p>The vault is the main page of the app. This is where you will access all your account data. To add an account into your vault, you will need to create a new vault entry. First, make sure you are on the Vault page. Then, press the '+' button on the top right of the app.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/empty-vault-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>At minimum, you must fill out the 'Title' field to create a vault entry. Make sure to give your entries descriptive titles so that you can easily identify them later. Below the 'Title' field, you will see the expected 'Username' and 'Password' fields. The 'Password' field has a generate button, represented by an icon of a die. On desktop or laptop, buttons within input fields will appear when you press on or hover over the input field, whereas on mobile they will be visible at all times. Pressing the generate button will fill in a random password for you based on the settings specified on the generator page.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/new-vault-entry-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>Next is the 'URL' field. This field is essential to autofill functionality. Without an entry here, your account will not appear in the browser extension's autofill menu. Autofilling usernames and passwords will save you a lot of time, so always try to enter a URL into this field even if you do not plan to use the browser extension or autofill functionality immediately. When entering URLs here, try to keep them as terse as possible. An example of a good, terse URL is 'amazon.com', and an example of a URL that is too verbose is 'https://www.amazon.com/example-item'. Although usually not necessary, you can add multiple URLs into this field by separating them with commas. For example 'microsoft.com, live.com'.</p>

		<p>After the 'URL' field is the 'Notes' field. Any extra information you want to associate with this vault entry can be added here. Following this is the 'Default' switch. If you would like this account to be the default for it's associated URL, flip the switch to the right. Doing this will automatically flip the 'Default' switches of all other accounts associated with the same URL to the left. Setting an account as the default is relevant for autofilling using the browser extension.</p>

		<p>Last is the 'Tags' section. Tags help you organize your vault. Press the '+' button in the tags section and the tags popup will appear. A list of all your created tags will be displayed on this main page of the popup. To create a new tag, press the 'New' button on the top right. To edit a tag, press the button with the pencil icon, and to delete a tag, press the button with the 'X' icon. On desktop or laptop, these buttons appear when you hover over the tag entry, whereas on mobile they will be visible at all times. Pressing the edit button will take you to a separate page where you can change the color and name of the tag. After you have made your modifications, press the 'Save' button and you will be brought back to the list of tags. To add a tag to the vault entry, press the desired tag entry in the list. The popup will close, and the selected tag will be added to the 'Tags' section of the vault entry. You can quickly edit individual tags by pressing directly on them rather than on the '+' button. To remove a tag from the vault entry, press the 'X' button on its right.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/tags-popup-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>When you have finished creating your vault entry, press the 'Save' button on the top right of the app. You will be brought back to the main vault page and your new entry will have been added to the vault.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="separator"></div>

	<!-- Vault – Editing Entries. -->
	<div class="article-section">
		<h3>Vault – Editing Entries</h3>

		<p>Each vault entry is represented by a card. The entry's title is at the top, followed by the username and URL. The bar at the bottom of the card contains a list of the vault entry's tags, as well as buttons for quickly copying the username and password to the clipboard.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/vault-single-entry-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>To edit the vault entry, press on the desired card. You will be brought back to the page covered in the previous section. However, you will now see a new history button on some fields, represented by an icon of a clock encircled by a counterclockwise arrow. This icon is on the 'Username', 'Password', and 'Notes' fields. Pressing it will open a popup containing the history of saved changes for that field. Each field of each vault entry has its own separate history list which can contain a maximum of ten entries. If the history for a field exceeds ten entries, the oldest value will be discarded to make room for the new one.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/vault-entry-history-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>You can copy a history entry's value to the clipboard by pressing the copy button, represented by an icon of two identical squares on top of each other. You can delete a history entry by pressing the 'X' button. On desktop or laptop, these buttons appear when you hover over the history entry, whereas on mobile they will be visible at all times.</p>

		<p>Aside from the addition of the history button, the process for editing vault entries is the same as for creating them. When you have completed your changes, press the 'Save' button and you will be brought back to the main vault page.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="separator"></div>

	<!-- Vault – Main Page. -->
	<div class="article-section">
		<h3>Vault – Main Page</h3>

		<p>After you have added a few entries to your vault, you can try searching through them using the search bar at the top of the main vault page. Searching will limit the displayed entries to only those whose titles contain the text you typed. There are also three search modifiers you can use for more advanced searches: 'username:', 'url:', and 'tag:'. Respectively, these modifiers will search for entries whose usernames, URLs, and tags contain the text following the colon. For example, if you want to search for vault entries whose URLs contain the word 'google', you would use this search modifier: 'url:google'. These tags can be used in combination with the default search method as well as with one another. For example, 'twitter username:john tag:mobile' will search for any entries with 'twitter' in the title, 'john' in the username, and 'mobile' in the tags. To go back to displaying all entries, clear the search bar.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/vault-multiple-entries-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>To the right of the search bar, you will see a history button, represented by an icon of a clock encircled by a counterclockwise arrow. Pressing on this will display a list of previously deleted vault entries. You can restore these vault entries by pressing the restore button, represented by an icon of a counterclockwise arrow. You can delete these entries by pressing the 'X' button.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/vault-history-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>You're now familiar with the most important page in Hyperpass - the vault page - where you can view, add, and edit your data. Next, we'll move on to the generator page.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="separator"></div>

	<!-- Generator. -->
	<div class="article-section">
		<h3>Generator</h3>

		<p>The generator page is the second of the Hyperpass app's three main pages. The top section contains the generated password as well as a few buttons. To copy the displayed password to your clipboard, press the copy button, represented by an icon of two identical squares on top of each other. To generate a new random password, press the generate button, represented by an icon of a die. The options below the top section determine how your passwords will be generated. By default, these settings are set to balance security and ease of typing. However, feel free to tweak these settings, sinc if your settings are different from the defaults, it will make your passwords more unique and thus more difficult to crack. Increasing the word or number count, or changing the separator are good choices. Having fewer than three words or two numbers in your final password is not recommended.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/generator-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>Using passphrases – passwords which use full words as a base – is recommended as they are easy to type while also being secure. Although you generally will not have to type your passwords in manually thanks to Hyperpass' copy to clipboard and autofill functionality, there still may be times where you need to do so. Nonetheless, for some, the increased security of fully randomized passwords outweighs the potential tedium of typing them. Hyperpass supports both methods of password generation, and you can switch between the two using the 'Mode' dropdown menu.</p>

		<p>When you make changes to the password generation settings, two new buttons will appear on the top section: a save button, represented by an icon of a floppy disk, and a restore button, represented by an icon of a counterclockwise arrow. Press on the save button to validate your new settings and save them. Press on the restore button if you would like to cancel your changes go back to your previously saved settings. The settings specified on the generator page will be used for password generation throughout Hyperpass. For example, pressing the generate button on the password input on the vault entry page will generate passwords using the same settings you save here. Your saved generator preferences will also be synced across all your devices.</p>

		<p>Now that you're familiar with the generator page, you can generate all sorts of passwords with Hyperpass. Let's move on to the final page of the app.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="separator"></div>

	<!-- Options. -->
	<div class="article-section">
		<h3>Options</h3>

		<p>On the options page, there are various settings and tools you can use. At the top of the page, there are two buttons: 'Log Out' and 'Sync'. Pressing the top 'Log Out' button will log you out of Hyperpass only on the device you are currently on. Although synchronization of account data data is done automatically, you can also manually synchronize by pressing the 'Sync' button. Synced data includes your vault, your generator settings, and the options set on this page.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/options-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>The first option is the 'Theme' option, which has two settings: 'Light' and 'Dark'.</p>

		<p>Following that is the 'Login Timeout' option. By default, it is set to '1 Day', which means you will be automatically logged out on this device after 24 hours and will be required to enter your master password to log in again. For most users this duration is a good balance between security and convenience. If you are on a public computer however, you may want to set a login timeout of '5 Minutes' on that device for better security, and if you are on a private computer the '1 Week' option will be more convenient.</p>

		<p>Below that is the 'Global Logout' button. Unlike the logout button at the top which only logs you out of the device you are currently on, pressing this will log you out of all of your devices. This is useful if you are unsure whether a device is still able to automatically sign in and want to ensure that it can't. After pressing this, the automatic login tokens for all your devices will be forcibly expired and you will need to enter your master password again on each to sign in.</p>

		<p>Next are the 'Import' and 'Export' options. Note that these options are not available on mobile. Using these, you can create and restore backups of your Hyperpass vault, or import vaults exported from other password managers. First, let's go over exporting.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="separator"></div>

	<!-- Options – Importing and Exporting. -->
	<div class="article-section">
		<h3>Options – Importing and Exporting</h3>

		<p>When exporting, there are two options for the format: 'Encrypted', and 'Unencrypted'. With encrypted exports, your information will remain secure even if someone gets access to the exported file as long as they do not know your master password. Exporting encrypted vaults regularly and storing them as backups helps ensure that you will never lose your valuable account information. On the other hand, if you export an unencrypted vault, anyone who gets access to that vault file will be able to see all the passwords and other information in your vault. Because of this, only export unencrypted vaults when necessary, and be sure to erase the file when you are done with it. When you have selected the format you want, press the 'Export' button and your file will be saved to your computer.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/export-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>Importing is a bit more complex. First, you must choose the format of the vault you want to import. You can choose from the two Hyperpass formats (encrypted and unencrypted) as well as formats that can be exported by other password managers. If you want to import an encrypted vault, you will need to enter the master password you used at the time you exported that vault so that it can be unencrypted. For any format, you can choose whether you want to trim the URLs in the vault to remove superfluous parts. Enabling this is recommended as URLs with unnecessary parts can cause the browser extension to not recognize the associated account as matching the website you want it to. For example, if you enter an account's URL as 'http://...' and then later access the website using HTTPS, it will not match. Last is the 'Mode' setting, which determines how the new entries will be combined with the existing ones. The default is 'Merge', which replaces existing entries with the values of the new ones if they share the same title. 'Append' is the conservative option. It will not modify any of the existing entries, instead appending a number to any newly imported entries that have the same title as an existing one. 'Overwrite' completely erases all existing entries and then imports the new ones. It is recommended that you export a backup of your existing vault before using this option. When you have selected the import settings you want, you can then press the 'Import' button on the top right. A file selection popup will then allow you to select the vault file you want to import.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/import-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>
	</div>

	<div class="separator"></div>

	<!-- Options, Continued. -->
	<div class="article-section">
		<h3>Options, Continued</h3>

		<p>After the 'Import' and 'Export' options is the 'Master Password' option. If you would like to change your master password, press the 'Change' button, enter the new master password you want to use, and confirm it. Then, press the 'Save' button and your vault will be encrypted using the new master password you entered from now on. The same considerations you made when creating your initial master password should apply. Additionally, because exported vaults are still encrypted using the master password you used at the time you exported them, it is recommended that you maintain a record of your relevant previous master passwords.</p>

		<hyperpass-image-loader [url]="'support/master-password-'+themeService.lowercaseTheme" [verticalAspect]="100/66"></hyperpass-image-loader>

		<p>Following the 'Master Password' option is the 'Support Page' button. Pressing this will open the support page in your browser in case you need to access this introduction guide or any of the other support articles. Below that is the 'Donate' button. Pressing this will take you to the PayPal donation page. Any support is appreciated. The last section on this page displays the version of Hyperpass you are currently running.</p>
