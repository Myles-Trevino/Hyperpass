		<h3>Creating Vault Entries</h3>

		<p>To add an account into your vault, you will need to create a new vault entry. First, log in to the Hyperpass app and make sure you're on the Vault page. Then, click the '+' icon on the top right of the app.</p>

		<p>At minimum, you must fill out the 'Title' input to create a vault entry. Make sure to give your entries descriptive titles so that you can easily identify them later. Below the 'Title' field, you will see the expected 'Username' and 'Password' inputs. The password input has a special button represented by an icon of a die. This icon will appear when you press on or hover over the input. Pressing the button will generate a password for you based on the settings specified on the Generator page.</p>

		<p>Next is the URL field. This field is essential to autofill functionality. Without an entry here, your account will not appear in the browser extension's autofill menu. Autofilling usernames and passwords will save you a lot of time, so always try to enter a URL into this field even if you do not plan to use the browser extension or autofill immediately. When entering the URL, try to keep them as terse as possible. An example of a good, terse URL is 'amazon.com', and an example of a URL that is too verbose is 'https://www.amazon.com/example-item'. Although usually not necessary, you can add multiple URLs into this field by separating them with commas.</p>

		<p>After the URL field is the 'Notes' section. Any extra information you want to associate with this vault entry can be added here. Following this is the default switch. If you would like this account to be the default for the entered URL, flip the switch to the right. This is relevant for autofilling using the browser extension.</p>

		<p>Last is the 'Tags' section. Tags help you organize your vault. Press the '+' button in the tags section and the tags popup will appear. A list of all your created tags will be displayed on this main page of the popup. To create a new tag, press the 'New' button on the top right. To edit a tag, click the button with the pencil icon, and to delete a tag, click the button with the 'X' icon. If you are on desktop or laptop, you will need to hover over the tag entry for these buttons to appear. Pressing the edit button will take you to a separate 'edit' page where you can change the color and name of the tag. After you have made your modifications, click the 'Save' button and you will be brought back to the main page. To add a tag to the vault entry, click the desired tag entry in the list. The popup will close, and the new tag will appear in the 'Tags' section of the vault entry. You can quickly edit individual tags by clicking directly on them rather than on the '+' button. To remove a tag from the vault entry, press the 'X' button on its right.</p>

		<p>When you have finished creating your vault entry, click the 'Save' button on the top right of the app. You will be brought back to the main vault page and your new entry will have been added to the vault.</p>
