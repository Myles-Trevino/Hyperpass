		<h3>Creating Vault Entries</h3>

		<p>To add an account into your vault, you will need to create a new vault entry. First, log in to the Hyperpass app and make sure you're on the Vault page. Then, click the '+' icon on the top right of the app.</p>

		<p>At minimum, you must fill out the 'Title' field to create a vault entry. Make sure to give your entries descriptive titles so that you can easily identify them later. Below the 'Title' field, you will see the expected 'Username' and 'Password' fields. The 'Password' field has a generate button, represented by an icon of a die. On desktop or laptop, buttons within input fields will appear when you press on or hover over the input field, whereas on mobile they will be visible at all times. Pressing the generate button will fill in a random password for you based on the settings specified on the generator page.</p>

		<p>Next is the 'URL' field. This field is essential to autofill functionality. Without an entry here, your account will not appear in the browser extension's autofill menu. Autofilling usernames and passwords will save you a lot of time, so always try to enter a URL into this field even if you do not plan to use the browser extension or autofill functionality immediately. When entering URLs here, try to keep them as terse as possible. An example of a good, terse URL is 'amazon.com', and an example of a URL that is too verbose is 'https://www.amazon.com/example-item'. Although usually not necessary, you can add multiple URLs into this field by separating them with commas. For example 'microsoft.com, live.com'.</p>

		<p>After the 'URL' field is the 'Notes' field. Any extra information you want to associate with this vault entry can be added here. Following this is the 'Default' switch. If you would like this account to be the default for it's associated URL, flip the switch to the right. Doing this will automatically flip the 'Default' switches of all other accounts associated with the same URL to the left. Setting an account as the default is relevant for autofilling using the browser extension.</p>

		<p>Last is the 'Tags' section. Tags help you organize your vault. Press the '+' button in the tags section and the tags popup will appear. A list of all your created tags will be displayed on this main page of the popup. To create a new tag, press the 'New' button on the top right. To edit a tag, press the button with the pencil icon, and to delete a tag, press the button with the 'X' icon. On desktop or laptop, these buttons appear when you hover over the tag entry, whereas on mobile they will be visible at all times. Pressing the edit button will take you to a separate page where you can change the color and name of the tag. After you have made your modifications, press the 'Save' button and you will be brought back to the list of tags. To add a tag to the vault entry, press the desired tag entry in the list. The popup will close, and the selected tag will be added to the 'Tags' section of the vault entry. You can quickly edit individual tags by pressing directly on them rather than on the '+' button. To remove a tag from the vault entry, press the 'X' button on its right.</p>

		<p>When you have finished creating your vault entry, press the 'Save' button on the top right of the app. You will be brought back to the main vault page and your new entry will have been added to the vault.</p>
