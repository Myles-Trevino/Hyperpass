		<h3>Importing Existing Accounts</h3>

		<p>If you're switching to Hyperpass from another password manager, you'll likely want to import your accounts. First, refer to your previous password manager's user guide for instructions on how to export your login data: <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95606" target="_blank">Google</a>, <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-login-data-firefox-lockwise" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/export-your-data/" target="_blank">Bitwarden</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho" target="_blank">LastPass</a>. If given an option for the type of export, select the unencrypted option. Your export should result in a .CSV file.</p>

		<p>Next, let's go through importing the exported data into Hyperpass. First, log in to the Hyperpass app, navigate to the Options page, and press the 'Import' button. Then, select the format of the vault you want to import. The format you select should correspond with the name of your previous password manager.</p>

		<p>In most cases, you will want to leave the 'Trim' option enabled. This will remove unnecessary parts of the URLs your accounts are associated with. Finally, select the 'Mode' you want. 'Merge' is suitable for most cases, while 'Append' is conservative and 'Overwrite' is destructive. If you're curious about the specifics of a mode, select it from the dropdown and its corresponding description will be displayed at the bottom of the page.</p>

		<p>When you have selected the import options you want, press the 'Import' button on the top right of the app. This will open a file selection window where you can select the .CSV file that you exported from your previous password manager. Once selected, the account data will be imported according to your settings.</p>
