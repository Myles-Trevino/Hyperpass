		<h3>Autofilling Usernames and Passwords</h3>

		<p>One of the main advantages to using a password manager is the ability to easily copy and autofill your saved usernames and passwords instead of typing them manually. Across all devices, you can easily copy and paste usernames and passwords from the vault by clicking the icons on the vault tiles. However, to use the autofill feature, you will need to install the browser extension. Once you have installed the extension, launch it from your browser's extensions menu and sign in. Note that the browser extension is separate from the web app, so you must sign into it separately as you would on the desktop or mobile apps. The extension will read the URL of your active tab and automatically load the accounts that are associated with that URL for autofilling.</p>

		<p>First, navigate to the login page of the website you want to log in to. Then open the browser's context menu on the input you want to autofill into. On Windows and Linux, the context menu can be opened by right-clicking, while on Mac, you may need to Ctrl-click instead. Installing the browser extension adds an entry for Hyperpass in this context menu. The menu entry will display as "Hyperpass (Locked)" initially, indicating that you are not logged in and thus will not be able to autofill. If you see this, launch the Hyperpass extension, log in, and open the context menu again. If you aren't sure about how to launch an extension in your browser, please refer to your browser's documentation.</p>
		<p>Once unlocked, a submenu will appear when you click on or hover over the Hyperpass context menu entry. If you have no accounts associated with the active tab's URL, this submenu will simply display 'No Accounts'. However, if you do have relevant accounts, the first two items are the 'Autofill Username' and 'Autofill Password' buttons. Clicking those will automatically fill in the username or password into the text input you clicked on. Make sure the blinking text cursor appears in the desired input before autofilling. If you have multiple accounts for a given website, an 'Active Account' submenu entry will appear. Hover over or click this to open another submenu where you can choose the account you want to use for autofilling. The last selected entry will be set as the default for next time.</p>

		<p>You can also use hotkeys to perform these autofill actions on most modern browsers and websites. By default, 'Autofill Username' is bound to 'Alt+U' in Chrome-based browsers and 'Ctrl+Alt+U' in Firefox. 'Autofill Password' is bound to 'Alt+P' in Chrome-based browsers and 'Ctrl+Alt+P' in Firefox. Again, you must be signed in to Hyperpass and have one or more accounts associated with the active URL to use autofill. You can check whether this is the case by opening the context menu as described above. You can quickly open the Hyperpass extension by pressing 'Alt+H' in Chrome-based browsers or 'Ctrl+Alt+H' in Firefox. Most browsers support user customization of these shortcuts. Please refer to your browser's documentation on extension keyboard shortcut customization for specifics.</p>
