		<h3>Generating Passwords</h3>

		<p>Creating good passwords is important for your online security. Hyperpass helps you generate secure passwords with the included generator. To configure how your passwords are generated, log in to the Hyperpass app and navigate to the 'Generator' page.</p>

		<p>The top section contains the generated password as well as a few buttons. To copy the displayed password to your clipboard, press the copy button, represented by an icon of two identical squares on top of each other. To generate a new random password, press the generate button, represented by an icon of a die. The options below the top section determine how your passwords will be generated. By default, these settings are set to balance security and ease of typing. However, feel free to tweak these settings, sinc if your settings are different from the defaults, it will make your passwords more unique and thus more difficult to crack. Increasing the word or number count, or changing the separator are good choices. Having fewer than three words or two numbers in your final password is not recommended.</p>

		<p>Using passphrases – passwords which use full words as a base – is recommended as they are easy to type while also being secure. Although you generally will not have to type your passwords in manually thanks to Hyperpass' copy to clipboard and autofill functionality, there still may be times where you need to do so. Nonetheless, for some, the increased security of fully randomized passwords outweighs the potential tedium of typing them. Hyperpass supports both methods of password generation, and you can switch between the two using the 'Mode' dropdown menu.</p>

		<p>When you make changes to the password generation settings, two new buttons will appear on the top section: a save button, represented by an icon of a floppy disk, and a restore button, represented by an icon of a counterclockwise arrow. Press on the save button to validate your new settings and save them. Press on the restore button if you would like to cancel your changes go back to your previously saved settings. The settings specified on the generator page will be used for password generation throughout Hyperpass. For example, pressing the generate button on the password input on the vault entry page will generate passwords using the same settings you save here. Your saved generator preferences will also be synced across all your devices.</p>
