		<h3>Generating Passwords</h3>

		<p>Creating good passwords is important for your online security. Hyperpass helps you generate secure passwords with the included generator. First, log in to the Hyperpass app and navigate to the 'Generator' page. The topmost section on the generator page contains the generated password. To copy the displayed password to your clipboard click the 'Copy' button, and to generate a new password, click the 'Generate' button.</p>

		<p>The section on the bottom left specifies how the password will be generated. By default, these settings are set to a good balance of security and ease of typing. However, it's best to tweak these settings slightly. If your settings are different from the defaults, it will make your passwords more unique and thus more difficult to crack. Increasing the word or number count or changing the separator are good choices for modification. Having fewer than three words or two numbers in your final password is not recommended.</p>

		<p>Using passphrases – passwords which use full words as a base – is recommended as they are relatively easy to type while also being secure. Although you generally will not have to type your passwords in manually thanks to Hyperpass' copy to clipboard and autofill functionality, there still may be times where you need to type a password in manually. Nonetheless, for some, the increased security of fully randomized passwords outweighs the potential tedium of typing them. Hyperpass supports both methods of password generation, and you can switch between the two using the 'Mode' dropdown menu.</p>

		<p>Whenever you generate a new password, it will be added to password history, which is displayed on the bottom left. To copy the password to your clipboard, press the button with the icon of two squares on top of each other. To delete the password, press the button with the 'X' icon. On laptop and desktop you must hover over the entry to see these icons. You can clear all history entries by pressing the 'Clear' button on the top right.</p>
