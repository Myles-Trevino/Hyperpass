		<h3>Generating Passwords</h3>

		<p>Creating good passwords is important for your online security. Hyperpass helps you generate secure passwords with the included generator. To configure how your passwords are generated, log in to the Hyperpass app and navigate to the 'Generator' page. The topmost section on the generator page contains an example generated password. To copy the displayed password to your clipboard click the 'Copy' button, and to generate a new password, click the 'Generate' button.</p>

		<p>The options below determine how your passwords will be generated. By default, these settings are set to balance security and ease of typing. However, it's best to tweak these settings slightly. If your settings are different from the defaults, it will make your passwords more unique and thus more difficult to crack. Increasing the word or number count or changing the separator are good choices for modification. Having fewer than three words or two numbers in your final password is not recommended.</p>

		<p>Using passphrases – passwords which use full words as a base – is recommended as they are relatively easy to type while also being secure. Although you generally will not have to type your passwords in manually thanks to Hyperpass' copy to clipboard and autofill functionality, there still may be times where you need to do so. Nonetheless, for some, the increased security of fully randomized passwords outweighs the potential tedium of typing them. Hyperpass supports both methods of password generation, and you can switch between the two using the 'Mode' dropdown menu.</p>

		<p>When you make changes to the password generation settings, the 'Generate' button changes to a 'Save' button. Click on the 'Save' button to validate your new settings and save them as the defaults for password generation across the app. For example, clicking the generate random password icon on the vault entry page will generate passwords using the same settings you save here on the generator page. Your saved generator preferences will also be synced across all your devices.</p>
