		<h3>How Do I Delete My Account?</h3>

		<p>Hyperpass stores your account information on servers to provide access to your vault across your devices. Your email address and generated unique device IDs are stored for authentication, and your encrypted vault is stored to be synced across your devices. To erase all information assocated with your account, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@hyperpass.org">support&#64;hyperpass.org</a> requesting account deletion. To ensure this is the intent of the account owner, the request must be sent from the same email address used to create the account. Once your request is processed, you will not be able to log into your account, and all associated information, including your password vault, will be permanently deleted from Hyperpass servers. Make sure to create a local backup! Deletion requests are typically processed within 24 hours.</p>
