		<h3>Which Technologies Does Hyperpass Use?</h3>

		<p>Hyperpass uses a set of carefully selected web technologies to create a unified, modern experience across all platforms.</p>

		<p>One of the main decisions when making a web app is the choice of framework. Currently, Angular and React are the two most popular options. The former is backed by Google and the latter by Facebook. React takes a minimalist, modular approach, acting as a foundation for third-party modules to build on. Angular on the other hand takes a comprehensive approach, including all the common functionality for web-app creation in one package. Although development with Angular is more strict, it is also more unified, well-documented, and stable. For these reasons, Hyperpass uses the Angular framework. Additionally, SCSS was used over plain CSS as its helpful extensions to the base language reduce verbosity and allow for more code reuse. One area SCSS shines in this project is in the use of imports to easily apply advanced shading to elements across the UI. TypeScript is also used in place of JavaScript. TypeScript makes creating large, complex web applications more practical thanks to strong, static typing features and linting and compile-time checks.</p>

		<p>These technologies work together to make creating quality web-apps practical and enjoyable. However, Hyperpass was designed to be available across all platforms, not just the web. Recent advancements over the past few years have made the ideal of using a single codebase across web, desktop, and mobile practical at last. Some solutions such as React Native or Flutter attempt to convert code into the native equivalent for each platform. While this may sound appealing initially, in practice, this method complicates the codebase, restricts UI design, and constantly falls out of date compared to true native apps. Instead of accepting these compromises, Hyperpass takes a fully web-based approach, using Electron for its desktop app and Capacitor for its mobile app. Both technologies create a web wrapper on the target platform while also providing access to commonly used native functionality such as window controls and biometric authentication.</p>

		<p>With this state-of-the-art stack, Hyperpass takes full advantage of the extreme flexibility web technologies afford while also maintaining a strict and organized codebase.</p>
