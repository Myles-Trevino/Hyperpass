		<h3>Which Technologies Does Hyperpass Use?</h3>

		<p>Hyperpass uses a set of carefully selected web technologies to create a unified, modern experience across all platforms.</p>

		<p>The main application development framework used in Hyperpass is Angular. Angular was chosen over React as it has a more structure and functionality. To create the same experience Angular provides by default in React, a number of additional smaller libraries would need to be used. Choosing Angular over a collection of smaller libraries ensures that everything integrates well and is of the same quality and maturity. For stylesheets, SCSS was used rather than plain CSS. SCSS provides helpful extensions to CSS which reduce verbosity and allow more code reuse. For example, SCSS imports allow advanced shading to be easily applied to elements across the codebase. Additionally, TypeScript is used rather than plain JavaScript. TypeScript helps make JavaScript more practical to use in large, complex codebases thanks to strong, static typing features as well as linting and compile-time checks.</p>

		<p>With these technologies, one can create a great modern web app. However, Hyperpass was designed to be available across all platforms, not only web. Recent advancements over the past few years have made the dream of using a single codebase across web, desktop, and mobile finally practical. Some solutions, such as React Native or Flutter attempt to convert the code into the native equivalent for each platform. While this may sound appealing initially, in practice, this method is not yet mature enough, complicates the codebase, and restricts UI design. Instead, Hyperpass takes a fully web-based approach. Hyperpass uses Electron for its desktop app and Capacitor for its mobile app. Both technologies essentially create a web wrapper on the target platform while also providing access to commonly used native functionality.</p>

		<p>With this modern stack, Hyperpass can take full advantage of the extreme flexibility web technologies afford while also having a strict and organized codebase.</p>
