		<h3>Who Is Behind This Project?</h3>

		<p>Hello! I'm Myles Trevino - the creator of Hyperpass. To my surprise, I found very few options when I was looking for a good password manager. Some had most of the qualities I wanted, but none were quite what I had hoped to find. Because having quick and secure access to all our usernames and passwords is so essential, I believe it's important to have a password manager we truly enjoy using. With Hyperpass, I set out to create a solution that is open-source, available for all platforms, and unified and modern in its functionality and UI. I hope that with this project, more users can find what they're looking for in a password manager.</p>

		<p>If you'd like to know more about me and the other projects I've worked on, I encourage you to visit <a href="laventh.com" target="_blank">my personal website</a>. Thank you for using my software, and thank you for your support.</p>
