		<h3>Why Use Hyperpass Over the Alternatives?</h3>

		<p>Three important aspects make Hyperpass stand out from the crowd: open-source code, availability on browser, desktop, and mobile, and unity of the UI and feature set.</p>

		<p>Applications handling sensitive personal information should ideally be open-source, meaning that the application code is available to view publicly. For many security-conscious users, this level of transparency is a requirement for applications handling such personal data. However, most password managers, such as Google's, LastPass, and 1Password are proprietary, keeping users in the dark about what exactly is being done with their personal information.</p>

		<p>A good service must be available on any device the user may need it on, and users may need their password manager on all their devices. However, of the open-source managers, almost none are available across the range of platforms users expect. For example, Mozilla's cannot be installed on browsers other than Firefox, and KeePass has no official mobile application. This leaves very few options for users who are looking for these two qualities in a password manager.</p>

		<p>In addition to satisfying these two attributes, Hyperpass provides a modern UI that is consistent in look and functionality across all platforms, filling a void in the password manager space. Hyperpass is unique in that it uses much of the same code for all platforms, enabling a focus on a strong core rather than an effort that is split between a multitude of platforms. This manifests in a better experience for you â€“ the user.</p>
