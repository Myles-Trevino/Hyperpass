		<h3>Why Use Hyperpass Over the Alternatives?</h3>

		<p>Three important aspects make Hyperpass stand out from the crowd: open-source code, availability on browser, desktop, and mobile, and unity of the UI and feature set.</p>

		<p>Applications handling sensitive personal information should be open-source, meaning that the application code is available to view publicly. For many security-conscious users, this level of transparency is a requirement for applications handling such important personal data. However, most password managers, such as Google's, LastPass, and 1Password are proprietary, keeping users in the dark about what exactly is being done with their information.</p>

		<p>A good service must be available on any device the user may need it on, and users may need their password manager on all their devices. However, of the open-source managers, almost none are available across the range of platforms users expect. For example, Mozilla's cannot be installed on browsers other than Firefox, and KeePass has no official mobile application. This leaves few options for users who are looking for a transparent and practical password manager.</p>

		<p>In addition to satisfying these two requirements, Hyperpass stands out from any other offering in its code adaptivity and consistent user experience. Other password managers use inflexible technology stacks which require reimplementing features for each platform, fragmenting development efforts. Hyperpass is unique in that it uses the same flexible core across web, desktop, and mobile. Every time developers make a change, it is reflected across all platforms. The codebase and the efforts of developers are unified, resulting in a consistent and reliable experience for users.</p>
