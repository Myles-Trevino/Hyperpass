		<h3>Which Apps and Extensions Should I Use?</h3>

		<p>Hyperpass is available across a wide variety of platforms so that you can access your data on any device. Because of this, there are quite a few Hyperpass clients to choose from: the web app, browser extension, desktop app, and mobile app. The web app is an easy way to get started with Hyperpass as it requires no installation. For the same reason, it can also be convenient if you need to quickly access your vault on a new device.</p>

		<p>Although the web app is convenient, it is a good idea to install the browser extension on desktop and laptop devices that you own. The extension allows you to autofill usernames and passwords into websites, which can save you a lot of time. Using the mobile app on your smartphone is also recommended, as unlike the web app, it can take full advantage of screen space and lets you use biometric authentication to quickly unlock your vault. The desktop app does not provide significant benefts when compared to the web app and browser extension, however it is a good option for users who prefer a client that is not tied to the browser.</p>

		<p>No matter which client you use, Hyperpass' interface is designed to be consistent and familiar. As many features as possible are available across all platforms, with platform-specific features only being added where necessary. Try out the different Hyperpass clients and decide which you want to use for yourself!</p>
