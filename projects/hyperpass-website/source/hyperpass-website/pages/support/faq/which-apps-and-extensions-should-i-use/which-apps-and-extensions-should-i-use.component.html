		<h3>Which Apps and Extensions Should I Use?</h3>

		<p>So that you can access your data on any device, Hyperpass is available across a wide variety of platforms. Because of this, there are quite a few Hyperpass clients to choose from: the web app, browser extension, desktop app, and mobile app. The web app is an easy way to get started with Hyperpass as it requires no installation. For the same reason, it can also be convenient if you need to quickly access your vault on a new device.</p>

		<p>Although the web app is convenient for quickly getting started, installing the browser extension on desktop and laptop devices that you own will take your experience to the next level. It will make Hyperpass easily accessible from your browser's extension tray and provide additional functionality such as username and password autofill and quick vault entry creation based on the active tab. Using the mobile app on your smartphone is also recommended, as unlike the web app, it takes full advantage of screen space and lets you use biometric login to quickly access your vault. The desktop app does not provide sigificant benefits over the web app and browser extension, however it is a good option for users who prefer a standalone client that can be quickly accessed from the taskbar or dock.</p>

		<p>No matter which client you use, Hyperpass' interface will be consistent and familiar. Most features are available across all platforms, with platform-specific features being added where applicable. Try out the different Hyperpass clients and decide which you want to use for yourself!</p>
